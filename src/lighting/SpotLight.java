/**
 * The SpotLight object specifies an attenuated light source at a fixed point in space that radiates light
 * in a specified direction from the light source. A SpotLight has the same attributes as a PointLight node,
 * with the addition of the following:
 * <p>
 * Direction - The axis of the cone of light.
 * <p>
 * Concentration exponent - Specifies how quickly the light intensity attenuates.
 * It attenuates as a function of the angle of radiation as measured from the direction of radiation.
 * The light's intensity is highest at the center of the cone and is attenuated toward the edges of the cone
 * by the cosine of the angle between the direction of the light and the direction from the light
 * to the object being lit, raised to the power of the spot concentration exponent.
 * The higher the concentration value, the more focused the light source.
 * <p>
 * A spot light contributes to diffuse and specular reflections, which depend on the orientation and position
 * of an object's surface. A spot light does not contribute to ambient reflections.
